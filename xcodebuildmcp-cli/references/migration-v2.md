# Migration from v1

Source: https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/migration-v2

Upgrading from MobileBuildMCP 1.x to 2.x. Two breaking changes; most users only need the first.

## The short version

### 1. Append `mcp` to your server launch command

MobileBuildMCP 2.x is a CLI first. To start the MCP server you must pass the `mcp` subcommand:

```
# v1.x
npx -y mobilebuildmcp@latest

# v2.x
npx -y mobilebuildmcp@latest mcp
```

If you added the server via a CLI command, remove and re-add:

```
# Claude Code
claude mcp remove MobileBuildMCP
claude mcp add MobileBuildMCP -- npx -y mobilebuildmcp@latest mcp

# Codex CLI
codex mcp remove MobileBuildMCP
codex mcp add MobileBuildMCP -- npx -y mobilebuildmcp@latest mcp
```

If you manage the config file directly, add `"mcp"` as the last entry in the `args` array.

### 2. Check your workflow configuration

In v1.x, all workflows loaded by default. v2.x defaults to loading only the `simulator` workflow to keep the agent's tool schema footprint small.

**Already set `enabledWorkflows` or `MOBILEBUILDMCP_ENABLED_WORKFLOWS`?** Nothing changes.

**Relied on the default?** Your agent will now only see simulator tools until you opt in to additional workflows:

```
# .mobilebuildmcp/config.yaml
schemaVersion: 1
enabledWorkflows:
  - simulator
  - ui-automation
  - debugging
```

See [Workflows](https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/workflows) for the full list.

## Detailed reference

### MCP server launch requires the `mcp` subcommand

Wherever your v1.x setup invoked `mobilebuildmcp` (or `npx -y mobilebuildmcp@latest`), append `mcp` so the final token is `mcp`.

Common config file locations:

| Client | File |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude.json` |
| Claude Desktop | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Cursor (project) | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Cursor (global) | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| VS Code (project) | `.vscode/mcp.json` |
| VS Code (global) | `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |
| Trae | `~/Library/Application Support/Trae/User/mcp.json` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/config.toml` |

JSON example:

```
"MobileBuildMCP": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "mobilebuildmcp@latest", "mcp"]
}
```

TOML example (Codex CLI):

```
[mcp_servers.MobileBuildMCP]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "mobilebuildmcp@latest", "mcp"]
```

### Why default workflows changed

In v1.x, all workflows loaded by default, exposing 70+ tools. Every tool definition and its schema is sent to the LLM on each turn, consuming context window space throughout the session. While most providers cache these tokens to reduce re-inference cost, they still occupy context that could otherwise be used for your code and conversation.

v2.x defaults to the `simulator` workflow. Other workflows (`ui-automation`, `debugging`, `device`, `macos`, `swift-package`, and more) are opt-in. Enable only what you need, when you need it.

### Enabling additional workflows

**Config file (recommended):**

```
schemaVersion: 1
enabledWorkflows:
  - simulator
  - device
  - macos
  - ui-automation
  - debugging
  - swift-package
```

**Environment variable:**

```
"MobileBuildMCP": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "mobilebuildmcp@latest", "mcp"],
  "env": {
    "MOBILEBUILDMCP_ENABLED_WORKFLOWS": "simulator,device,macos,ui-automation,debugging,swift-package"
  }
}
```

## New in v2: CLI and skills

### CLI mode

The same `mobilebuildmcp` binary is now a CLI first. You can invoke tools directly:

```
npm install -g mobilebuildmcp@latest

mobilebuildmcp tools
mobilebuildmcp simulator build-and-run --scheme MyApp --project-path ./MyApp.xcodeproj
mobilebuildmcp simulator screenshot
mobilebuildmcp ui-automation snapshot-ui --simulator-id <UDID>
mobilebuildmcp ui-automation tap --simulator-id <UDID> --element-ref e12
```

See [CLI](https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/cli) for the full guide.

### MCP vs CLI for agents

The MCP server remains the recommended way to use MobileBuildMCP with an agent. The CLI is provided as an alternative for scripting, CI, and direct terminal use.

Why MCP is preferred:

*   **Automatic tool discovery**: tools are registered with the agent at session start.
*   **Session defaults**: the server maintains stateful defaults across tool calls, so the agent doesn't re-supply project details on every invocation. Significantly reduces errors.
*   **Stateful operations**: log capture, debugging sessions, and other long-running operations are managed by the server.

The CLI avoids the per-turn context cost of MCP tool definitions, but loses session defaults and forces the agent to pass every parameter on every call. In practice, agents use MCP more reliably.

### Agent skills

v2 introduces two optional agent skills that prime the agent with usage conventions:

*   **CLI Skill**: strongly recommended when using the CLI with an agent.
*   **MCP Skill**: optional when using the MCP server.

Install:

`mobilebuildmcp init`

See [Agent Skills](https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/skills) for flags and supported clients.

## New in v2: project config

v2 adds support for a project-local config file at `.mobilebuildmcp/config.yaml`. It replaces the need for scattered environment variables and gives you deterministic, repo-scoped behavior. Env vars still work but the config file takes precedence.

```
schemaVersion: 1
enabledWorkflows: ["simulator", "debugging"]
sessionDefaults:
  workspacePath: ./MyApp.xcworkspace
  scheme: MyApp
  simulatorName: iPhone 17 Pro
```

Create or update it interactively:

`mobilebuildmcp setup`

See [Configuration](https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/configuration) for the full schema.
