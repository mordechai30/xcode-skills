# Agent Skills

Source: https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/skills

Prime your agent with MobileBuildMCP's conventions so it stops guessing flag names.

MobileBuildMCP ships with two optional [agent skills](https://agentskills.io/home):

*   **MCP Skill**: how to call MCP tools. Optional when you're already using the MCP server, because Claude Code already receives equivalent guidance via server instructions.
*   **CLI Skill**: how to navigate the CLI. Recommended when your agent drives the terminal.

## Install

`mobilebuildmcp init`

This auto-detects installed AI clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) and installs the CLI skill into the right directory for each.

## Options

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--skill cli` | Install the CLI skill (default). |
| `--skill mcp` | Install the MCP skill. |
| `--client claude` | Install to Claude only. Other targets: `cursor`, `codex`. |
| `--dest /path/to/dir` | Install to a custom directory. |
| `--force` | Overwrite an existing skill. |
| `--remove-conflict` | Auto-remove a conflicting variant (MCP vs CLI). |
| `--uninstall` | Remove an installed skill. |
| `--print` | Print skill content to stdout instead of installing. |

Claude Code + MCP skill

When installing `--skill mcp` in auto-detect mode, Claude Code targets are skipped: Claude already receives MCP guidance through server instructions. Pass `--client claude` explicitly to force install.

## Unsupported clients

For clients without a skills directory, print the skill and pipe it where you need it:

`mobilebuildmcp init --print --skill mcp > my-mcp-skill.md`

Then paste it into your client's instructions area, or feed it as system prompt context.

## Why skills

The skills prime the agent with:

*   Tool names and their CLI equivalents
*   Session-defaults workflow (`session_set_defaults` first, then minimal calls)
*   Build-and-run as the preferred one-shot instead of separate build/install/launch
*   Structured next-step hints after each tool call

Agents without the skill still work; they just spend more tokens rediscovering conventions.
