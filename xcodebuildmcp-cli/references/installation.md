# Installation

Source: https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/installation

Install MobileBuildMCP via Homebrew or npm. Both give you the CLI and the MCP server. Once installed, head to Setup to wire it into your editor.

Requires macOS 14.5+Xcode 16.x+Node.js 18+ (npm only)

## Requirements

*   macOS 14.5 Sonoma or later
*   Xcode 16.x or later (Xcode 26+ unlocks the [Xcode IDE Bridge](https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/xcode-ide))
*   Node.js 18+ if using the npm install path
*   Homebrew if using the Homebrew install path

## Option A: Homebrew (recommended, no Node.js)

```
brew tap getsentry/xcodebuildmcp
brew install mobilebuildmcp
```

## Option B: npm / npx

For CLI use, install globally:

```
npm install -g mobilebuildmcp@latest
mobilebuildmcp --help
```

For MCP-server-only use, no global install needed, just reference `npx` in your MCP client config (covered in [Setup](https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/setup)).

Pin a specific version by replacing `@latest` with a tag, for example `@2.3.2`.

## Keeping it up to date

Once installed, run the built-in self-update command:

`mobilebuildmcp upgrade`

It checks for a newer version and installs it in place using whichever package manager you installed with. See [CLI → Keeping the CLI up to date](https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/cli#keeping-the-cli-up-to-date) for available flags.

## Verify

Run the doctor to check your environment:

`npx --package mobilebuildmcp@latest mobilebuildmcp-doctor`

Or, if you installed globally:

`mobilebuildmcp-doctor`

The doctor reports on Node/Xcode versions, required dependencies, environment variables, and feature availability. Always include its output when filing an issue.

## Uninstall

```
# Homebrew
brew uninstall mobilebuildmcp

# npm
npm uninstall -g mobilebuildmcp
```

## Next step

With MobileBuildMCP installed, head to [Setup](https://www.mobilebuildmcp.com/docs/setup) to wire it into your editor, run the project config wizard, and do your first build.
